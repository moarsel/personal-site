# Project Background

Global fintech company Davis + Henderson (D+H) hired our team at Architech to help them reimagine an innovative mobile platform through design thinking. Our project team of designers, developers, and a strategist dived right in to understand their business, interview their customers, and build working prototypes to validate solutions for the next generation of their platform.

We all worked closely with several of D+Hs product managers to research the customer's experience, and then build and validate solutions in order to iterate as quickly possible. In addition to conducting interviews, and collaborating on the design, I implemented several functional prototypes with Angular.js and a brandable modification of Google's material design system. Our technical set up enabled me to iterate the product as quickly as the design evolved. This lean set up gave us a very fast feedback loop, enabling us to build and deploy UI changes in between user interviews.

## Research Methodology

Using the [Jobs-To-Be-Done](https://jtbd.info/) methodology, we interviewed several potential users in order to really dig into the customers perspective. This research helped us understand how we could solve _real_ user problems and develop very clear requirements to drive the direction of the platform.

After our initial research stage, we built out and iterated upon a prioritized list of interface components and user flows. We then looped back and tested our original hypotheses through several usability tests and stakeholder interviews. This discovery (and re-discovery) process helped define the capabilities that D+H should invest in, while minimizing the risk involved in launching such a cutting edge initiative.
