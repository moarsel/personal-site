## Background

In 2019, I had the opportunity to work and travel for a very cool project. Working with one of the world's biggest fashion retailers, we built a design system that enables rapid, high quality delivery of their e-commerce applications across all brands and regions.

We had a blast facilitating design workflow process improvement, React architecture education, and I even got to head up development of a design tool that empowers designers and developers to collaborate more effectively.

A case study was written up here: [https://rangle.io/our-work/retailer-design-system/](https://rangle.io/our-work/retailer-design-system/)
