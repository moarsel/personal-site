## Background

Through a fellowship with Code For Canada, I had the privilege of working with the City of Toronto on a [system transformation program](https://codefor.ca/blog/towards-more-coordinated-access-to-housing-in-toronto/) for our homelessness system, through a fellowship with Code for Canada. We made incremental progress in building new software features with the users of homelessness services, following an inclusive design methodology.

Much more remains to be written about it, but snapshots of our work can be seen below.
